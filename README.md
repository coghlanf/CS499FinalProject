  <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>

  <p>My name is <strong>Fernanda Coghlan</strong>, and this ePortfolio represents the culmination of my academic journey in the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. Throughout the program, I have grown from a learner with a strong background in engineering into a capable and versatile software developer. The ePortfolio presented here demonstrates my technical proficiency, problem-solving abilities, and professional readiness through carefully selected and enhanced software artifacts.</p>

  <p>This capstone project provided me with the opportunity to revisit and improve a mobile application originally developed during CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming. The <strong>FLC Weight Tracker App</strong> was chosen as my central artifact and enhanced across three major categories: <em>software design and engineering</em>, <em>algorithms and data structures</em>, and <em>databases</em>. This approach allowed me to focus on one real-world, functional application while applying a wide range of technical skills and architectural patterns to bring it to production quality.</p>

  <h2>Strengths Gained Through the Program</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Software Engineering & Design:</strong> I applied the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture and repository patterns to improve modularity, scalability, and separation of concerns within the app. These patterns, along with a rigorous refactor of UI logic, reflect my strong grasp of modern design principles.</li>
    <li><strong>Algorithms & Data Structures:</strong> I designed and implemented a weekly trend detection algorithm using <code>TreeMap</code>, <code>LocalDate</code>, and structured sorting logic. This provided me with firsthand experience translating domain problems into efficient, testable algorithmic solutions.</li>
    <li><strong>Databases:</strong> I integrated the Room persistence library to replace in-memory data storage with a robust, lifecycle-aware database system. Additionally, I utilized SharedPreferences to handle lightweight user settings, ensuring the app retained data across sessions.</li>
    <li><strong>Security Mindset:</strong> I developed secure data-handling practices, such as proper use of Android’s SharedPreferences for sensitive information and contextual data validation to avoid crashes or data leaks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Collaboration, Communication, and Growth</h2>
  <p>Although this final project was completed independently, I consistently demonstrated collaboration and communication throughout the program in peer reviews, group discussions, and code walkthroughs. I developed fluency in explaining design decisions and documenting enhancements with clarity—skills reflected in the narratives and code review video within this ePortfolio. These are critical when collaborating in team environments or communicating technical solutions to non-technical stakeholders.</p>

  <h2>Career Aspirations</h2>
  <p>My immediate career goal is to transition into a remote software development role that allows me to build meaningful, user-centered applications. I am particularly interested in mobile development and backend data handling. Long-term, I intend to specialize further in full-stack engineering and eventually contribute to software architecture decisions at an organizational level. This ePortfolio helps position me for those opportunities by clearly presenting my applied skills and the tangible outcomes of my work.</p>

  <h2>Portfolio Overview</h2>
  <p>This ePortfolio contains:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <strong>code review video</strong> describing the original artifact and enhancement plans.</li>
    <li>Three enhanced versions of the <strong>FLC Weight Tracker App</strong>, demonstrating growth across:
      <ul>
        <li>Software Design and Engineering</li>
        <li>Algorithms and Data Structures</li>
        <li>Databases</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Detailed <strong>narratives</strong> for each enhancement, explaining the purpose, implementation, skills demonstrated, and course outcomes achieved.</li>
    <li><strong>Screenshots and walkthroughs</strong> showing before-and-after views of the code and UI.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each enhancement aligns with specific <em>course outcomes</em> and showcases the depth of my technical knowledge, critical thinking, and ability to deliver reliable, user-friendly software. Together, these artifacts tell the story of my development as a computer science professional ready to enter the field with confidence and creativity.</p>
